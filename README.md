## Key Features
- **Dynamic User Interaction:** Reactivity powered by `useState`.
- **Advanced React Concepts:** 
  - Utilized `refs` for direct DOM manipulation.
  - Implemented `Portal` for rendering components outside the main React DOM tree.
  - Leveraged `useImperativeHandle` for better control of child component methods.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Concepts Utilized
### 1. **Refs and Portals**
Used `refs` for efficient DOM manipulations and `Portal` to render specific components outside the normal DOM structure.

### 2. **useState**
Managed dynamic state across components to handle real-time user interactions.

### 3. **useImperativeHandle**
Exposed specific methods from child components to parent components for enhanced control and modularity.
